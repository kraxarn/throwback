        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
            By creating an account, and using our website beyond the home screen, you agree
            to our privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>
            Only information required to be collected from Spotify are ever
            stored and never shared with any third-party. Please note that it is not currently
            possible to delete an account yourself, other than revoking access to the app through
            your Spotify dashboard.
        </p>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            By "we" and "our", we mean the developers of the app, "you" means you as in your
            user, and "your account" is your Spotify account, you get the idea.
        </p>

        <h3>Data collected</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>A token for your spotify account.</b> This only lets us access your account
                until the token is revoked. When the token is revoked, we can no longer access
                any of your content on Spotify.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Your Spotify email address and name.</b> The email address, username and
                full name connected to your Spotify account is currently stored, even after
                access to your Spotify account is revoked. This is currently not used for
                anything, but only automatically collected by Supabase.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Anonymous data</h3>
        <p>
            No anonymous data is currently being collected. No site tracking, nothing.
            This might change at some point, but most likely not, as we would even block
            it ourselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Cookies hold your current logged in session, nothing else.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-party</h3>
        <p>
            No information is ever shared with any third-party, and never will.
        </p>

        <h3>Account deletion</h3>
        <p>
            As this website is currently a very work-in-progress, this is currently
            not easily possible. Please open an issue on GitHub, or get in contact
            with us directly and we can work something out.
        </p>
